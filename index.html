<h1>About</h1>

Hi, I'm Arthur, a second year mathematics undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge. I hope to gather here some things related to the maths tripos and some more things of general interest.

<h1>Tripos</h1>

<h3>IB</h3>
<a href="/assets/opti.pdf"> Optimization</a> <a href="/assets/opti.tex">(source)</a> - a (currently incomplete) set of notes intended to provide more of a background to a course I think is extremely underrated.

<h3>Other recommended resources</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://dynalist.io/d/ToOhEKlz9qC2PmpjgyTpXQJz">Intuition-focused second year notes</a> by Neel Nanda. Some also available for third year courses, too.</li>
	<li><a href="https://hh457.user.srcf.net/mathmo-guide/">The mathmo guide</a> of almost 1000 reviews of tripos courses. Contribute your own, save a puremo from attending a physics course!</li>
	<li>General notes by <a href="http://zb260.user.srcf.net/notes/">David Bai</a> and <a href="http://qk206.user.srcf.net/about/">Qiangru Kuang</a> - not as well known as Dexter's, but often more up to date (and better!).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Competitive Programming</h1>

I'm actively involved with programming competitions for both school and university students. If you're interested, take a look at the <a href="https://uccps.soc.srcf.net/beginners/"> beginner's events</a> the UCCPS has put on (including an interactive workshop and several tailor-made contests).

I also regularly compete in contests on <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/arthurconmy">Codeforces</a> and <a href="https://atcoder.jp/users/arthurconmy">AtCoder</a> (both sites have ELO-like rating systems, and are recommended).

<h1>Recommended Reading</h1>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/geombook.html">EGMO</a> - Probably the most exciting maths book I've read. Many, many 'aha!' moments to be had.</li>
	<li><a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html">Neural networks and deep learning</a></li> - the author probably doesn't know what a mathmo is, but this was written for mathmos, something that can't be said for many machine learning texts.
</ul>
